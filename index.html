              <h4>What is the project?</h4>

              <p>While discussing this project, we quickly came up with the idea to talk about the nostalgia of our country/home. Therefore we decided to study the foreign community in Shanghai where we both live. The project proposal is to analyse the behavior behind the migration of foreigners in Shanghai and more specifically why they leave Shanghai.
              </p>

              <p>Shanghai can be said to be one of the most international places in mainland China, with a lot of expats living in Shanghai for a long time. It has been growing rapidly since 2000, but in recent years the total number of permanent foreign residents has leveled off, and in some years has even fallen. It's worth noting that this statement does not include the new Covid19 outbreak that occurred in late 2019. We want to know why, and maybe we can figure it out with the data numbers.
              </p>
              
              <h4>Where is the data coming from?</h4>
              
              <p>The data come from the Shanghai Statistical Yearbook (http://tjj.sh.gov.cn/tjnj/20200427/4aa08fba106d45fda6cb39817d961c98.html) which offer the most accurate data about Foreigners in Shanghai as this data source give official information about the number of permanent residents visa delivered. Unfortunately, the latest report is from 2019 and only provides data from 2000 to 2018.
              </p>
              
              <h4>What are the specific ethical considerations for this project?</h4>
              
              <p>We need to be careful not to analyze data out of thin air, but to put it in context, such as the Shanghai World Expo in 2010, or the outbreak of the epidemic in China in 2019. We have to put data into these stories for analysis. We would like to quote:
              </p>
              <p>In Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective (1988), Donna Haraway argues that objectivity in science and philosophy is traditionally understood as a kind of disembodied and transcendent "conquering gaze from nowhere."
              </p>
              <p>The survey should remain anonymous to offer freedom of speech and avoid people to be tracked down by Chinese authorities if people mention something sensitive. This may be a source of bias as people may submit more than one survey. Also, we need to consider that online platforms that have ways to do anonymous questionnaires may not be really anonymous as they have strong links with their government, so we need to be careful on which platform/tool to use to do those surveys in order to protect as much as possible the people who will reply.
              </p>
              <p>Even if it is not an ethical consideration per se, we know that we will need to be careful of shortcomings, and a lot of hypotheses would be wrong at the beginning, so we plan to repeat the process of research & analysis of quantitative and qualitative data to refine as much as possible the project.
              </p>
